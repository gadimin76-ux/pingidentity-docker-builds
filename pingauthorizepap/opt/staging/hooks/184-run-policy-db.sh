# The PAP introduced a new tool, policy-db in 9.2.0.0-GA. It upgrades a PostgreSQL policy
# database using the values in configuration.yml when the PING_POLICY_DB_SYNC environment
# variable is present. Because it performs an upgrade, it must be run regardless of whether
# this is a pristine container or is restarting. However, it reads the values within
# the configuration.yml, and therefore must be run after setup. The PING_POLICY_DB_SYNC
# environment variable is specific to the pingauthorizepap container and not
# recognized by the application. However, the --no-prompt option requires the presence
# of PING_DB_ADMIN_USERNAME and PING_DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD. Those variables are validated
# by the application.

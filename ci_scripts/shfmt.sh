    -d, --diff
        Finds all shell files in the current working directory (recursive)
        which contain formatting that differs from shfmt's configuration.
        If found, diffs of these occurrences are printed. This is the default.

        Overwrites all shell files in the current working directory (recursive)
        which contain formatting that differs from shfmt's configuration.
        If found, files are updated to use the configured format for the project.
    -f, --file
        target a specific file rather than the default behavior of analyzing
        all the eligible files in the project
